XMLHttpRequst is amazing, because it changed the world, but it is also terrible.

Even the name is awful. Why are all the letters in XML capitalized, but HTTP
is written Http?

The API is cruddy and unfriendly and scary and until recently didn't reliably
work the same in all browsers. THERE IS A BETTER WAY

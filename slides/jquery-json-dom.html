  The previous example has a few problems. It might not work in old browsers,
  and it is a little bit verbose.

  We can make it a little bit cleaner with some jQuery sprinkles.

  A lot of frameworks will abstract this away from you and give you a nicer
  way of doing it, but it is great to know how to do it all by hand so you
  appreciate what farmeworks do.


  NOTE: do i talk about frameworks here vs rolling your own?

  Time to talk a little about how computers actually talk to each other.

  Compters are connected on networks. Your computer isn't connected directly to google, but it is connected to someone who is connected to someone who is connected to google.

  To talk to google, your browser uses HTTP, a protocol or set of rules for communication, to tell a server what data it wants. The server then sends a response back, wrapped in the HTTP protocol, which the browser knows how to understand.

  Phone call analogy for protocol -

  Phones identified by numbers. Answer and say hello. Say who is calling. Listen while others are talking. Hanging up is rude, unless you are in a movie. Also NEVER CALL ONLY TEXT GEEZE.

  Evaluate if i need to explain protocols more or not.

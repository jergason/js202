  I'm doing a lot of things to make concepts easier to understand. I'm teaching AJAX and JSON.

  I'm NOT teaching how to build scalable and maintainable JavaScript applications.
  Lots of the things we are doing are to help you understand concepts. You should
  be able to get stuff working and make stuff.

  Once you have this stuff down, there is another skill set to build great JS
  apps. If you are interested I'd be happy to talk more about it after, at other
  GDI events, on twitter or meetup or email or w/e.

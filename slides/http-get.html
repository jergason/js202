<h2>What is that 'GET'?</h2>

<pre><code class="js">req.open('GET', 'http://google.com', true)
</code></pre>

<p><code>GET</code> is part of HTTP. It means "get me the data at this URL".</p>

<p>GET requests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can be cached for faster lookup later</li>
  <li>Remain in your browser history</li>
  <li>Can be bookmarked</li>
  <li>Have length restrictions</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes">
  HTTP defines a concept of "VERBS". In HTTP, you hit URLs to get and set data.
  You can use VERBS to tell the server what you want to do with the URLs. GET is
  the most common one. It just means you want to retrieve whatever is at that
  URL.

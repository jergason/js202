<p><code>POST</code> is another HTTP verb. It means "save or update this data".</p>

<p>POST requests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a body that contains the data for the server to process</li>
  <li>Can't be bookmarked</li>
  <li>Are used by form submission</li>
  <li>Are neato!</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes">
  POST is another HTTP verb, just like GET. You send an HTTP request to a URL,
  but this time you say you are POSTing some data instead of GETting some.

  This means you want the server to save your data.

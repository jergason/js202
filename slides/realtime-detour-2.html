<h2>Realtime detour</h2>
<pre><code class="js">setInterval(getNewestDataFromServer, 5000)
</code></pre>

<p>Upside: super duper simple on client and server</p>
<p>Downside: very wasteful. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<aside class="notes">
  How does this help us with realtime data? Well, what if we put our function that gets data from the server inside a setTimeout loop?

  This has some downsides, but we will ignore them for now! Bug me after if you want to know more about building realtime applications in a scalable way.

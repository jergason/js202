  Web 1.5 is fuzzier, but you could define it as "sprinkles of interaction."
  Documents are still being sent down from the server, most interactions that
  involve data still cause page reloads. However, with the rise of javascript,
  users can interact with web pages purely in the browser, without needing
  to go back to the server for updates. This means things like showing or hiding
  tabs, changing images as your cursor rolls over them, accordian menus, etc,
  are all possible.

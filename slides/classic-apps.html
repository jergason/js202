<h2>Web 1.0</h2>
<h3>Static Content</h3>

<ul>
  <li>display a webpage</li>
  <li>wait for user interaction</li>
  <li>query the server for data</li>
  <li>reload the webpage</li>
</ul>

<p>The user has "down time" - a period of time where they can't interact with the webpage at all.</p>

<aside class="notes">
Web 1.0 is the original vision for the web and HTML. It is document-based. The
user clicks links, and the server sends down a completely new web page in
reponse to every user interaction.</aside>

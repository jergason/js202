  JSON looks like JavaScript because it *is* JavaScript!  Life is easy for us
  in JS because working with JSON is freeeeeeeeeee!  However, other languages
  can produce and consume JSON as well. It just might not match up with their
  languages syntax, so they have to encode and decode things to and from JSON.

<h2>Develop It! Exercise 4</h2>

<p>See the <a href="../exercies/4.html">exercise file</a> for details.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="../materials/json_starter.html"><code>materials/json_starter.html</code></a> file from the class exercises.</p>

<p>Update your previous exercise to use <code>$.ajax</code> to POST your message to the server when the user clicks the button. You should still insert the message into the DOM as well.</p>

<p>Make sure to handle errors!</p>

  One theme you will notice over and over:

  PUT YOUR CODE IN FUNCTIONS. It should all be in functions. Functions make it easier to understand what your code is doing, easier to change, and easier to write.

<h2>Homework</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We hard-coded everything to one room. Allow the user to switch rooms!</li>
  <li>Instead of having a text field for username, create a signing form that saves the username when the page is first loaded. Reuse that name instead of pulling it from a text field every time.</li>
  <li>Create a "firehose" view of messages that lists message from every room as they come in.</li>
</ul>
